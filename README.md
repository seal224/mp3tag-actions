Backup of custom [mp3tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/)/[puddletag](https://github.com/puddletag/puddletag) actions.   
Note that any `code` here is not actual code but must instead be implemented using the software GUI. The way they are noted down here is identical to how they appear in each software's actions menu once set up properly; this should be self-explanatory.

The main (and original) file with detailed explanations for each action is [mp3tag-actions](https://github.com/seal224/tagging-actions/blob/main/mp3tag-actions.md). [puddletag-actions](https://github.com/seal224/tagging-actions/blob/main/puddletag-actions.md) implements the same actions for puddletag.
