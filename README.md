Backup of custom [mp3tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/)/[puddletag](https://github.com/puddletag/puddletag) actions.   
Note that any `code` here is not actual code but must instead be implemented using the software GUI.

The main (and original) file with detailed explanations for each action is [mp3tag-actions](https://github.com/seal224/tagging-actions/blob/main/mp3tag-actions.md). [puddletag-actions](https://github.com/seal224/tagging-actions/blob/main/puddletag-actions.md) implements the same actions for puddletag.
